**LearnJavaByExamples**
A collection of beginner-friendly Java exercises to practice programming basics, including Scanner usage.

**üìù Purpose:**
Welcome to the **LearnJavaByExamples Repository**! üéâ This project is aimed at helping new programmers learn Java through hands-on coding challenges. Being a first-year university student, I decided to create this account and share my exercises and projects with others. For me, coding is like learning a new language, and to not forget even the simplest concepts, I try to practice daily. I hope these exercises can help you on your journey, just as they help me grow and learn. Let's learn Java together! üöÄ
